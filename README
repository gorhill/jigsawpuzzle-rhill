ABOUT
-----

I started this project as an experiment with the HTML5 canvas element.
It grew a bit bigger than what I had imagined, as I kept adding features,
just for the fun and challenge of dealing with geometrical concepts.
Also, for jigsaw puzzle fans out there, I am just happy to enable you to
create your own puzzle, small or big, easy or hard, and with no strings
attached (no ads, no questions asked, etc.)
